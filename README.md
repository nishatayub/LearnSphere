```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         PRESENTATION LAYER (MVC)                │
│  ┌─────────────┬─────────────┬─────────────┐   │
│  │ Controllers │ Razor Views │ ViewModels  │   │
│  └─────────────┴─────────────┴─────────────┘   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                      ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         APPLICATION LAYER                       │
│  ┌─────────────────┬─────────────────────────┐ │

### 🎫 Support Ticket System

**Comprehensive Student Support & Feedback Mechanism**

Students can raise tickets for various concerns through an intuitive workflow:

#### Ticket Flow
```
1. Click "Raise Ticket" button
   ↓
2. Select Ticket Type from dropdown:
   ├── 📝 Feedback
   ├── 😞 Complaint
   ├── ❓ Doubt/Question
   ├── 🔧 Technical Issue

   ↓
4. Submit & receive ticket ID
   ↓
5. Track status & receive responses
```

#### Ticket Categories

| Category | Purpose | Assigned To |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| **📝 Feedback** | Course reviews, suggestions, improvement ideas | Instructor + Admin |
| **😞 Complaint** | Instructor behavior, course quality, unfair practices | Admin |
| **❓ Doubt/Question** | Academic doubts beyond course content | Instructor |

### 🏆 Peer Learning Reputation System

**Turn Learners into Teachers, Build Real Communities**

#### How Students Earn Reputation

| Activity | Points | Verification |
|----------|--------|--------------|
| **Explain Concepts** | +15 | Upvoted by peers/instructor |
| **Review Peer Assignments** | +10 | Quality review verified |
| **Help Debug Code** | +20 | Solution marked as helpful |
| **Answer Forum Questions** | +5 | Answer accepted |
| **Create Study Guides** | +30 | Downloaded 10+ times |
| **Mentor Juniors** | +25 | Mentee completes milestone |

#### Reputation Tiers

```
🌱 Novice        (0-50 points)    - Learning Phase
📚 Contributor   (51-200 points)  - Active Helper
⭐ Expert       (201-500 points) - Recognized Authority
🎓 Mentor       (501-1000 points)- Community Leader
🏆 Master       (1000+ points)   - Top 1% Contributors
```

#### Anti-Gaming Mechanisms
- **Diminishing Returns** – Helping same person repeatedly gives fewer points
- **Quality Checks** – AI + instructor review of explanations
- **Downvote System** – Poor quality content reduces reputation
- **Time Investment** – Points unlock only after peer engagement
- **Plagiarism Detection** – Copied explanations flagged automatically

#### Employer-Visible Benefits
- **Reputation Badge** on certificates
- **Skill Endorsements** from peers
- **Public Profile** showcasing contributions
- **Recommendation Letters** auto-generated for top mentors

**Why Most LMS Avoid This:**  
❌ Hard to prevent gaming  
❌ Moderation overhead  
❌ Fear of toxic competition  

**Why It's Powerful:**  
✅ Learning-by-teaching solidifies knowledge  
✅ Builds vibrant learning communities  
✅ Demonstrates soft skills to recruiters  
✅ Reduces instructor support burden  

### 📊 Skill Score System

**Measure Competence, Not Just Completion**

#### Beyond Course Completion Certificates

Traditional LMS issue certificates for *watching videos*. LearnSphere measures **actual competence**.

#### Skill Score Components

```
Total Skill Score (0-100)
├── 40% - Project-Based Assessments
│   └── Real-world tasks, not multiple choice
├── 25% - Code Quality (for technical courses)
│   └── Automated analysis of submitted code
├── 20% - Peer Review Performance
│   └── How well you explain concepts to others
├── 10% - Time Efficiency
│   └── Problem-solving speed
└── 5% - Consistency
    └── Regular practice over time
```

#### Skill Gap Analysis

**After course completion, students see:**

| Skill Area | Your Score | Industry Standard | Gap Analysis |
|------------|------------|-------------------|--------------|
| API Design | 72/100 | 80/100 | 📈 Practice REST principles |
| Database Optimization | 45/100 | 75/100 | ⚠️ Review indexing strategies |
| Authentication | 88/100 | 70/100 | ✅ Above average |

#### Job-Readiness Indicator

```
🎯 Skill Score: 78/100
📊 Industry Benchmark: 75/100
✅ Job Ready for: Junior Backend Developer
📈 Next Level: Senior Role (requires 85+)

Recommended Actions:
1. Complete "Advanced Database Design" module
2. Build 2 more portfolio projects
3. Contribute to open-source (reputation boost)
```

**Why LMS Don't Have This:**  
❌ Hard to standardize across courses  
❌ Requires subjective evaluation  
❌ Instructors resist grading complexity  

**Why It's Powerful:**  
✅ Recruiters trust competence scores over completion certificates  
✅ Students understand their exact gaps  
✅ Differentiates serious learners from passive viewers  
✅ Data-driven career guidance  

### 🧠 Post-Course Memory Decay Prevention

**Maintain Real Competence After Completion**

#### The Forgetting Curve Problem

Research shows learners forget **70% of course content within 30 days** without reinforcement. Most LMS stop caring after course completion. LearnSphere doesn't.

#### Spaced Repetition System

```
Course Completion
  ↓
+7 days  → Quick Quiz (10 min) - Core concepts
  ↓
+30 days → Skill Check (20 min) - Practical application
  ↓
+90 days → Full Re-assessment (45 min) - Comprehensive test
  ↓
+180 days → Project Challenge - Build something real
```

#### Forgotten Skill Detection

**Adaptive Testing Algorithm:**

1. **Identify Weak Areas** – Questions you got wrong
2. **Re-test Periodically** – Spaced intervals (7, 30, 90 days)
3. **Detect Skill Decay** – Score drops below 70%
4. **Auto-suggest Refreshers** – "You scored 55% on SQL Joins. Revisit Lesson 4?"

#### Refresher Micro-Courses

- **5-10 minute modules** reviewing key concepts
- **Interactive challenges** not passive videos
- **Real-world scenarios** not theoretical questions
- **Progress tracking** shows retention improvement

#### Gamification for Long-Term Engagement

| Streak | Reward |
|--------|--------|
| 30-day refresh streak | 🔥 "Consistent Learner" badge |
| 90-day retention score >80% | 🏅 "Knowledge Keeper" achievement |
| 1-year active skill maintenance | 💎 "Lifelong Learner" certification |

#### Employer Integration

**Certificate Validity Indicator:**

```
John Doe - Full-Stack Development Certificate
Issued: Jan 2025
Last Verified: Nov 2025
Retention Score: 87% ✅ (Skills actively maintained)

vs.

Jane Smith - Full-Stack Development Certificate  
Issued: Jan 2024
Last Verified: Jan 2024
Retention Score: N/A ⚠️ (Skills may have decayed)
```

**Recruiters can trust certificates with recent verification.**

#### Why LMS Ignore This

❌ Engagement ends at course completion (revenue captured)  
❌ Long-term tracking is complex  
❌ Students resist "more tests"  

#### Why It's Game-Changing

✅ Maintains actual competence, not just credentials  
✅ Certificates stay valuable over time  
✅ Students build habits of continuous learning  
✅ Data shows who's truly job-ready vs. credential collectors  
✅ Instructors get feedback on content retention  

**Implementation Note:**  
This feature uses background jobs (Hangfire/Quartz) to schedule periodic assessments and email reminders.
